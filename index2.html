                <h2>Background Story</h2>
                <p>My name is William Oliver. I was born and raised in West Virginia.
                    I transfer from Davis & Elkins College to Milligan College in the 
                    fall of 2016. I was an Accounting Major student before I transfer to
                    Milligan, I decided to switch to Business Administration upon my arrival
                    to Milligan College. I am now 23 years old and I play baseball at Milligan College.
                    I was an outfielder, I had a 300 career batting average.
                    I graduated from Milligan in 2019 with a bachelor's degree in Business
                    Administration. In May 9 of 2020 I will graduate from Milligan
                    for the second time with a degree in Information Systems.</p>
